/*ECMA (European computer manufacturers association) gives the rules/guidance for the syntax of JS and they came up with new syntax known as ES6
6 features of ES6 are:-
1. let and const keywords: used to create block level variables
2. arrow functions: reduced the length of code for creating a function
3. classes: teplates to create objects
4. default parameter values: allows to pass argument through a function by default
5. find() and findIndex method: helps you to find the element or index of an array
6. exponentiation(**): raises the first operan to power of second operand*/

//template strings
var a = 10;
var b = 20;
var c = a+b;

console.log("c = "+c)//this is ES5 syntax
console.log(`c = ${c}`)//this is ES6 syntax
