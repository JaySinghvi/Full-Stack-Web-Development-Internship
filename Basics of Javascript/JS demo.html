<!--Javascript is used for adding implementation to the html elements like buttons, text, input fields, submit). It has no compilation step
it is client side for front end; easy to learn node js(backend) and react js/angular(front end)
MERN: mongo databse; express(server); react(front end); node js(back end)

If we learn php then we have to learn another lang for frontend and not much support so js is best-->

 <!--Including JS in html can be done in many methods:
1. In head tag: used when user clicks on something and some logic needs to be executed
2. in body tag: used when we don't want any action from user and the context is displayed immediately upon loading page
3. in both head and body tag
4. in external file and then import that file in this using the link

Data types in JS are of 2 types:
1. Primitive data types:- numbers, strings, boolean (basic)
2. Reference data types:- objects, arrays, functions (derived based on basic/primitive datatypes)

objects: group of other multiple members within the curly parantheses(just like structure in c).
eg: emp = {id: 1, name:"ram", sal: 1000, display:(){body of function} } we can also add function in object where "display" is the keyword and the value is body of function

arrays: basic datastructures which are loop of multiple members of similar datatypes
eg: empname = ["ram", "rahul", "laxman", "riya"] this is string datatype
    empid = [1,2,3,4] this is numbers datatype-->

    <!--this is the function syntax just like in c we used to write function. the syntax is :function(which is the keyword) function-name(){alert("context")}
       so hellojavascript is user defined function and alert is a predefined function-->
    <script type="text/javascript">
        function hellojavascript() 
        {
           alert("hello user welcome to the digital world") 
        }
    </script>

<!--this is for method 4(external) for which we use src to link the external file-->
    <script text="text/javascript" src="./method4(external).js"></script>

</head>
<body>
    <!--document.write is another predefined function to print the context-->
    <script type="text/javascript">
        document.write("Hello welcome!!") 
    </script>

    <button type="button" onclick="hellojavascript()" style="background-color: orange">Welcome</button>
    <!--so when the user clicks on button "welcome" the webpage will show the message written in the context for which we use onclick for method 1-->

    <button type="button" onclick="external()" style="background-color: orange">Method 4</button><!--button for method 4-->
