/* postman is an application for testing API's (application program interface and means functionalty), 
by sending a request to the webserver and getting the response back.

to test api there should be a client who will send a request and server provides a response but if there is no client we use postman

to make a request (postman to server) we need:
1. url: link to request for access to resources 
2. method: specifies the server what action to perform. eg: put, get, delete
3. header: provides meta data about request
4. body: contains data to be sent to server for processing request 

the repsonse (server to postman) would contain:
1. status code: gives 3 digit no. saying about status of request. eg: 404 for not found
2. header: says about content-type like json or xml
3. body: gives info which is asked for*/
